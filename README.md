# EdmundsDataScraper
Data Scraping Library for Edmunds.com (Used Car Website) and Data Analysis

* In this project I developed a library which scrapes data through API Endpoints of Edmunds.com

* You can adjust your scraping filter based on year and brands.

* I added an additional notebook that  shows How you can scrape data with the library I developed

* Then I applied EDA and Statistical Analysis for this dataset.

* With the latest update you can add your scraped data to a database by using send_to_database function

* I added an extra data processing  function which applies more data cleaning (ML Friendly)
