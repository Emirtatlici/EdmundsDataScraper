# EdmundsDataScraper
Data Scraping Library for Edmunds.com (Used Car Website) and Data Analysis

* In this project I developed a library which scrapes data through API Endpoints of Edmunds.com

* I added 2 additional notebooks First of them  shows How you can scrape data with the library I developed, In the second notebook I showed how you can scrape all of the data that is listed on edmunds.com by changing the parameters. Because edmunds.com has set some restrictions for data scraping in these notebooks I show the ways where you can avoid those restrictions. 


* Then I applied EDA and Statistical Analysis for this dataset.

* With the help of scraper you can scraper 56 pages per minute since there are 21 car data for every page you basically get 1176 data for each minute of scraping.

* With the latest update you can add your scraped data to a database by using send_to_database function

* I added an extra data cleaning function which applies more data cleaning
